/**
* Here is the workflow:
*
* The URI (via the URL or a form action) is first parsed in boostrap.php (via ParseURL.php), which then
* then intantiates model and view and calls the desired method.
*
* The general URL/URI syntax is as follows:
*
*     http://www.domain.com/controller/action/querystring
*   
* Or, another way to look at it is:
*
*     http://www.domain.com/class/method/
*
* If input has been set via $_POST, it is then passed to the subcontroller (and set via set()).
* and which then passes it to the front/main Controller, which passes them to the view (also via set()).
*
* Upon destruction, the main/front Controller then renders the view (calling $_view->render()). This
* extracts the variables set (via set()) and includes the subview file (which is included as view_file.php)
*
* Because these variables were set via the View and the subview file was included at the same time,
* the included file has access to use these variables/data structures (and display them accordingly).
* and the View then extracts these variables and makes them available to the subview to
